I read a StackOverflow article:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25567744/backup-neo4j-community-edition-offline-in-unix-mac-or-linux

====

1) It details how to backup/restore a local copy of neo4j.
2) Read the file: "README_FOR_NEO4J_RESTORE"
3) If the link doesn't work, and the file is missing, here are the restore instructions below:


service neo4j stop && cd /var/lib/neo4j/data/databases/ && rm -r graph.db && tar xf /var/backups/neo4j/10_25_2016.gb.tar.gz -C /var/lib/neo4j/data/databases/ && service neo4j start

--service neo4j stop = stop the neo4j service

--cd /var/lib/neo4j/data/databases/ = change directories to your neo4j dir where the graph.db is located

--rm -r graph.db = remove the current graph.db and all its contents

--tar xf /var/backups/neo4j/10_25_2016.gb.tar.gz -C /var/lib/neo4j/data/databases/ = Extract the backup to the directory where the old graph.db was located. Be sure to adjust the filename 10_25_2016.gb.tar.gz to what you called your file

--service neo4j start = restart neo4j
